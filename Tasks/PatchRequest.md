<h1>difference between patch and put request</h1>
<h2>PUT Method in Laravel</h2>
<p>
The PUT method is typically employed for updating or creating a resource at a specific URL. One of its key attributes is its idempotent nature, which means that making multiple identical requests should yield the same outcome as a single request. When utilizing the PUT method in Laravel, the entire resource must be included in the request payload, replacing the existing resource or creating a new one if it doesn't already exist.</p>



<h2>PATCH Method in Laravel</h2>
<p>
In contrast to PUT, the PATCH method is geared towards making partial updates to a resource. This means that only specific fields of the resource are modified, leaving the rest unchanged. The flexibility offered by PATCH makes it an ideal choice for scenarios where you only need to update certain attributes of a resource without affecting others.</p>

<h2>When to Use PUT and PATCH</h2>
<p>
1 PUT: Utilize PUT when you need to perform a complete update of a resource, and you have all the necessary data available.
2 PATCH: Opt for PATCH when you only want to modify specific attributes of a resource while leaving others unchanged.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>use PUT when you want to replace the entire resource, and use PATCH when you need to update only specific fields.</p>
